Requires ruby 1.8.7 for some of the Runt functionality.

This is a very, very early version of something sort of like Google Calendar done in Rails.

You can preview it at http://www.wiseleyb-runt-gui.com

I'll probably be converting this to a Rails 3 engine at some point.

Overview:

This is a UI that generates data to create Runt temporal expression http://runt.rubyforge.org/ to support Google calendar like scheduling.  

You can store day specific information in schedule_details.  As an example if you click on a particular day you can write notes about that
specific day.  It creates these records as needed - allowing you to have an event that repeat forever without having to generate all that data.

This isn't even close to scalable yet... it's barely even useable right now.
